### 2. Annotation errors: improve messages, highlight visually

**Status**: Pending since yesterday, On track for total hours, will resume after I've met my commitment to get Elad a testing url ASAP.

> Can transfer repo to `stackbit-themes` org if desired, but I do not intend to maintain it once this task is complete, unless asked to do so.

3-3 Cleared up "user presets" functionality w/ Vanesea (turns out this was just the name of already known concept, they do not belong tp authenticated user like I had thought)
